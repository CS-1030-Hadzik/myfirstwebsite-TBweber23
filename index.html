        <hl>About Me:</hl>

        <p>My name is Talan, and I am an amateur programmer. I have enjoyed programming and coding since I first gave it a try, a few years ago.
            My programming and coding experience lies most heavily in Python, but I have branched out into SQL, and because of this awesome 
            assignment, HTML as well. HTML looks to be a ton of fun, and I am hoping you like the look of my corner of the Internet here.
            My hope is to learn enough programming languages and database and now website related coding to be able to create a fully
            fledged, fully built out website of my own to showcase my skill in tech overall.
            One of my favorite hobbies aside from coding and tech is swimming, and pictured below is a photo of me at Pineview
            two years ago. My family and I went together, and it was a lot of fun. We didn't take the boat that time as we 
            normally do, but it was fine because we are all amazing swimmers.

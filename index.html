        <hl>About Me:

        </hl>

        <p>My name is Talan, and I am an amateur programmer. I have enjoyed programming and coding since I first gave it a try, a few years ago.
            My programming and coding experience lies most heavily in Python, but I have branched out into SQL, and because of this awesome 
            assignment, HTML as well. HTML looks to be a ton of fun, and I am hoping you like the look of my corner of the Internet here.
            My hope is to learn enough programming languages and database and now website related coding to be able to create a fully
            fledged, fully built out website of my own to showcase my skill in tech overall.
            One of my favorite hobbies aside from coding and tech is swimming, and pictured below is a photo of me at Pineview
            two years ago. My family and I went together, and it was a lot of fun. We didn't take the boat that time as we 
            normally do, but it was fine because we are all amazing swimmers.

        <hl>Programming Projects:</hl>
        <p>In order to flex my programming skills and abilities, I will talk about some of my projects that I have created using the different
            languages and programs to date. As stated before, most of my skill lies in Python. I've created several different programs and scripts,
            with the express purpose of aiming to automate my day-to-day life and increase speed and efficiency of both my workload for school and my
            increasing the speed at which progres can be made on my personal projects. The programs I have created select random integers and then
            make choices based on that, take user input and perfom different mathematical fuctions, as well as opening different files Windows Explorer
            and taking the user to different websites in the default browser depending on what their desired website is. My favorite websites that help
            me further my programming knowledge are:
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube!</a>
            <br>

            

            Additionally, I have created a table below to show my favorite places to swim, my favorite TV shows, and my favorite foods!
